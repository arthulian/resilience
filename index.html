                (a) Emotional impulses derail focus; outcomes miss targets, (b) control restored after significant deviation; results rely on external correction, (c) maintains consistency with regular checks; achieves outcomes under moderate pressure, (d) detects early warning signs and refocuses quickly; meets goals under heavy pressure, and (e) remains well-regulated under ongoing, complex pressure; minimal correction needed.
