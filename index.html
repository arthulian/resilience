                    <p>(a) Gets overtaken by emotion, impulse, or distraction and loses track of goals without regaining focus.

(d) Quickly notices when off-course and resets fast; stays on track even under serious pressure. (e) Maintains stability and direction through ongoing stress; little to no course correction needed.</p>

(b) Can make sense of things, but usually only after someone else provides missing context or facts. (c) Writes out assumptions and verifies at least one key idea; avoids distortion under moderate spin. (d) Cross-checks early and stress-tests differences; understanding holds under strong distortion. (e) Rapidly re-forms an accurate picture as new info comes in; gaps automatically prompt fact-checking; minimal backtracking.</p>

                    <p>(a) Falls for believable but false ideas; uses feelings or authority as proof; results miss the real goal.

(d) Tries to break down the argument using logic and opposing ideas; holds up under strong persuasion. (e) Quickly sees layered flaws in reasoning; keeps thinking clear even when pressure is high.</p>
